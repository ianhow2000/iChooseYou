                        I graduated in Sunway University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
                        I made this website mainly to show my passion and skillset for web development, and what better way to showcase it than to use a fun little way of selling pokemon as pets?
                        I developed this website mainly using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I feel that its a good way to show my strong foundation for the languagues.

                        To briefly introduce myself, I enjoy computers very much, from building it from scratch to gaming on it, enough to say that I am a computer enthusiast.
                        As for my personality, I am very driven in life, and I am willing to do whatever it takes to get what I need to succeed in my career.
                        For my traits, I have great people-skills, I communicate well with anyone that I come accross and I am a fun guy to have around. Not only that,
                        I am also a great team-player, not just in game but also in real life! I will try my best to help my team excel and achieve the goal!
